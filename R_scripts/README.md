# dsfuncs R_script style

My go-to is typically Python, but in an effort to both learn R and add some additional functionality to this repository, I've ported over some of the Python code in dsfuncs to R. If there's anything in particular that you see in some of the Python modules that you'd like ported over to R, drop me a line. For the time being, I've just ported over what I've found most useful/relevant for projects that I've been working on.
